# Jenkins
### 1. CI/CD Pipelines (High Priority)
üìå What to Prepare:
Jenkins or other CI/CD tools (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, etc.)

Multi-environment deployment (Dev, QA, Stage, Prod)

Approval gates for production deployments

Integration with security scans and notifications

üéØ Key Interview Questions and Sample Answers
### Q1: Explain how you designed a CI/CD pipeline for microservices.
Sample Answer (based on real-world scenario):

In one of my projects, we had multiple microservices, each in its own Git repo. I used Jenkins for CI/CD.

#### For CI: 
When a developer pushes code to the develop branch, it triggers a Jenkins pipeline that:

Pulls the latest code.

Runs unit tests (e.g., via Maven or Pytest).

Performs SAST using tools like SonarQube.

Builds Docker images and pushes them to ECR.

#### For CD:

On merging into the main branch, we trigger the deployment job:

Pulls Helm charts or Terraform modules.

Deploys to Kubernetes (EKS or AKS) using Helm.

Has manual approval step before Prod.

Canary or Rolling Update strategy was used to reduce risk.

### Q2: What Git workflow did you follow?
Answer:

We followed the Gitflow workflow:

``` feature/* ``` branches for new features.

``` develop ``` branch for integration testing.

``` release/* ``` for staging preparation.

main for production-ready code.

Pull Requests were mandatory with peer review.

Tags were used for versioning artifacts in the CI pipeline.

#### ‚úÖ Pull Requests with Peer Review
#### üß© What It Means:
Before any code can be merged into the main branch (or develop), it must go through a Pull Request (PR) and get approved by reviewers (usually 1‚Äì2 team members).

üõ†Ô∏è How It‚Äôs Done:
On GitHub / GitLab:
Developer creates a feature branch:
``` git checkout -b feature/add-login ```

Pushes code to remote:

``` git add .
git commit -m "Added login feature"
git push origin feature/add-login ```
Creates a Pull Request (PR) from feature/add-login ‚Üí develop.

Set GitHub/GitLab rules:

Require at least 1‚Äì2 reviewers.

Block merge if there are code conflicts or failed checks (like build/test failures).

Run CI pipeline on PR using GitHub Actions or Jenkins:

Linting

Unit tests

SAST scan

Once approved and checks pass ‚Üí merge is allowed.

üîí Why Important in CI/CD:
Ensures code quality, security, and collaboration.

Stops broken or insecure code from reaching shared branches.

Triggers CI jobs automatically after push or merge.

‚úÖ Tags for Artifact Versioning
üß© What It Means:
Tags mark a specific point in Git history as a release version (e.g., v1.0.0).
These tags are used in pipelines to version:

Docker images

Helm charts

Deployment releases

üõ†Ô∏è How It‚Äôs Done:
Example with Git:
```
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0
```
Jenkins Setup:
Use Jenkins to detect a new Git tag (via webhook or poll).

Trigger pipeline only on tag events.

Use the tag name as version in Docker image:

```
docker build -t myapp:${GIT_TAG} .
docker push myapp:${GIT_TAG}
Jenkinsfile Snippet:
groovy
Copy
Edit
environment {
  GIT_TAG = sh(script: "git describe --tags", returnStdout: true).trim()
}
stage('Docker Build') {
  steps {
    sh "docker build -t myapp:${GIT_TAG} ."
    sh "docker push myapp:${GIT_TAG}"
  }
}
```
üöÄ Why Use Tags:
Easy rollback: deploy an earlier version by tag.

Every artifact (image, release, etc.) is linked to a clear version.

Promotes reproducibility in deployments.

### Q3: How do you implement approval gates in your pipeline?
Answer:

I implemented manual approval steps in Jenkins using the input step.

After deployment to staging, a notification goes to Slack or email.

An approver (e.g., Dev Manager) must click "Proceed" to deploy to production.

We also implemented GitHub PR approvals before merging to main as a pre-check.

### Q4: How do you manage different environments in your pipeline?
Answer:

We use different config files or Helm value files for each environment.

The Jenkins job uses parameters or environment variables to select the target (Dev, QA, Prod).

The same pipeline template handles all environments using conditionals.

### Q5: What tools did you use in your pipeline for notifications or alerts?
Answer:

Slack/GitHub Notifications via Jenkins plugins or custom scripts.

Email notifications for failures.

We integrated Google Chat for real-time updates on build/deploy status.

Used monitoring tools like Prometheus & Grafana for infra alerts.

### üí° Best Practices to Mention:
Use parameterized pipelines.

Store secrets in Vault or AWS Secrets Manager, not in Jenkinsfiles.

Keep your pipelines modular and reusable.

Use Docker caching and parallel builds to improve speed.



## Pipeline example

```
pipeline {
  agent any
  parameters {
    choice(name: 'ENV', choices: ['dev', 'qa', 'prod'], description: 'Target environment')
  }
  stages {
    stage('Checkout') {
      steps {
        git branch: 'main', url: 'https://github.com/your-repo.git'
      }
    }
    stage('Build & Unit Test') {
      steps {
        sh 'mvn clean install'
      }
    }
    stage('Docker Build & Push') {
      steps {
        sh 'docker build -t myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER} .'
        sh 'docker push myapp:${BUILD_NUMBER}'
      }
    }
    stage('Deploy') {
      when {
        expression { params.ENV != 'prod' }
      }
      steps {
        sh "./deploy.sh ${params.ENV}"
      }
    }
    stage('Manual Approval for Prod') {
      when {
        expression { params.ENV == 'prod' }
      }
      steps {
        input message: "Deploy to production?"
        sh "./deploy.sh prod"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
